# AI Class Documentation
> This repository serves as a self-documentation of my AI class at university. I'll try to improve it in my spare time.

During the class, I learned some fundamental AI concepts that I found important, so I decided to document them. Honestly, I did this mostly to help myself remember everything LOL :v

Alright, here we go!
